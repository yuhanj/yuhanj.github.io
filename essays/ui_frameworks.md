  Many people might have such a question: why do we need to use UI frameworks? I think the answer is simple: it helps us create better UI and saves time.

  Learning a new framework like semantic UI indeed takes a lot of time. It's not easy to understand all the terms. Semantic UI is a powerful tool with tremendous implements that helps build a website. However, the abundance of functionality also means the cost of time to learn.

  It has been less than one week since I first time tried to learn semantic UI. I took half of my day watching the videos about semantic UI. After that, I decided to put my previous work into the new framework. The most significant difference is that I don't need to use my own stylesheet as much. Semantic UI has most UI designs already built-in. The only thing I need to do is to set a correct class name for the element.

  Here is the website I created within 40 minutes. I think experienced web developers will take much less time with their familiar UI framework.
<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tori-richard.jpg">

  Semantic UI is so neat. The class names for the elements are basically the same as English language. For example, if I want to insert an menu to my web page, I can write class="ui menu". If I don't want the border between the items, I can change the class name to "ui borderless menu".
