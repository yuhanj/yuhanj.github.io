When people code for themselves, coding standards don't seem to be an important issue. As long as the variable names make sense to the programmers, they use whatever name they want. I've seen some programmers showing their code on technical communities with incredibly messy structures. I also know a guy who uses abbreviations for everything, and he uses a memo for the actual name of those variables. I also see people complain about their colleagues using unreadable function names like "function1", "function2", etc.

Back to tens of years ago, many programmers just program for their own. They only need to care if the program works or not. It's true that in the past when the size of memory and storage is a critical issue, it's wise to shorten the length of the code. 

It's 2019 now. It's more than 30 years after the first version control system was released. One of the main ideas about version control is to let software developers work together on a big project. When a programmer has terrible coding habits, it's hard for other people to use his/her code. It's like you want to show your solution of a math problem to your friend, your axis directions are to the opposite side, and there are some unknown symbols in your algebra. You can still explain how it works; however, your friends will need more time to understand it. The same thing happens in coding. You may save 30 seconds using the fast way you like; however, who wants to read your code may spend three more minutes to understand your coding style. When your team grows, or you wants to show your code to the whole world, things get even worse because everyone needs to spend time learning your coding philosophy.
