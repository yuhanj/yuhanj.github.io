Hello! My name is Yuhan Jiang. I was born in China. I've been in Hawaii for three years. Now I'm a Junior student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 

I like video games. I spend a lot of time on various video games. There is a question that I often think one thing about when I'm playing video games: if I am the game developer, what changes can I make to this game to make it better? 

Since I was in elementary school, I started to make my little games with RPG Maker. I want to become a game developer and know more about software engineering. I also like to read articles and watch videos about game designs. I like to learn the story and designing behind the game. 

Some people will think computer science is a boring major. However, I think learning programming is something fun to do, and I'm learning the essential skills for game development. I believe that practice makes perfect. It is like the development of the player's character in an RPG game. It's not wise to fight against an enemy when my character is too weak. I may reload the game again and again to win the fight, but the better way is to level up and get better weapons. For the following semesters, I'd like to keep the hard-working on learning various skills in computer science.
