summary: My first VR Project.

"Final Quest" is a VR game demo I made this semester. I have no previous experience before this project. Creating a VR game is quite challenging, and I learned a lot from online tutorials about VR, C# Scripts, and Visual Graphics Effects. I also used some ideas I got from some academic papers about how to reduce VR motion sickness. I set the game background to the countryside at night and applied a heavy fog effect to minimize visibility. I think these settings worked well and helped me get rid of motion sickness.

Even though this is a simple VR game, I had a lot of fun making it. One of my friends provided some Tiki models, and I used those Tiki models as the "wands" in the game. I learned from the online tutorials about making guns grabbable and fireable; then, I changed the guns to Tikis to create a more fantastic experience. I also invited another friend to be the voice actor for the skeleton enemies. I shared some video clips of the game during the development with my friends, and they started to enjoy the fun of making video games.
