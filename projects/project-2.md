summary: A Java based simple game developed for ICS 211.
---

PokemonGone is my final project for ICS 211. This object-oriented project integrates many of the essential contents covered in ICS 211. Each pokemon in this game has its class file.

In this game, the player is a pokemon trainer. The player can catch wild pokemon and fight against other pokemon trainers. The general idea of this game is based on the Pokemon series.
