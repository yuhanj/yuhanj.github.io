summary: I volunteered as a tutor to teach students to learn Chinese at Kapiolani Community College.
---

In 2017, I got a chance to be a voluntary Chinese language tutor at Kapiolani Community College. I taught students how to speak in Chinese and how to write Chinese characters. In this experience, I got the opportunity to have more interaction with other students and instructors, and these interactions helped me be more confident, more polite, and more respectful. I also met many new friends during volunteering.

I found that people who have more interests can do better in learning a language. Most students who wanted to learn Chinese had some general and superficial understanding of Chinese culture. When I was a tutor, I didn't only teach them about their classwork. I also encouraged students to talk about their interest in Chinese culture to help them have a deeper understanding.
