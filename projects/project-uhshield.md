## What is HACC?

<img class="ui big right image" src="../images/HACC.png">

<a href="https://hacc.hawaii.gov/">Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC)</a> is a unique hackathon that lasts for a few weeks to encourage the developers and the event sponsors to communicate and provide sustainable solutions for the state of Hawaii.

In this year, I joined the HACC 2020 with my friends <a href="https://tianhuizhou.github.io/">Tianhui Zhou</a> and <a href="https://heweiron.github.io/">Weirong He. We together worked on the UH building security topic and won the third prize.
